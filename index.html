        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Umut Kocak, and I am a seasoned professional in computer graphics and computer vision, with a career spanning back to 2004.
        My journey from image processing to computer graphics has exposed me to a wide range of projects, including volume rendering, haptic rendering,
        physics simulation, real-time rendering, photogrammetry, 3D reconstruction, computer vision, deep learning, and ray tracing.
        I find joy in understanding the intricate relationships between mathematical models and real-world phenomena, especially those involving visual imagination.
        I have mostly worked on demanding real-time interactive projects, and as a result, I have developed expertise in GPU programming, code optimization,
        and memory monitoring. I enjoy seeing not only the big picture but also paying attention to details, as the saying goes: "The devil is in the details."
		</p>
		<p>
        Apart from technical challenges, I have occasionally taken on diverse roles, including teaching, mentorship, project management, Scrum Master, and team lead.
        I enjoy socializing in person with colleagues and sharing silly jokes.
		</p>
		<p>
        I prefer to spend my free time actively outdoors. In the past, I’ve enjoyed snowboarding, playing tennis, and running, but lately, my knees have been
        telling me to find other hobbies. Therefore, I have been focusing on more sustainable activities like freestyle swimming and sailing. My lifelong passion
        also includes partner dances such as salsa, bachata, and zouk.
		</p>
		<p>
        After living in different countries, I eventually settled in Berlin, where I started my own family and discovered my latest passion—spending time outdoors with my son.&#128151;
